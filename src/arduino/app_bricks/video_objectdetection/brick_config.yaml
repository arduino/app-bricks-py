name: Video Object Detection
description: |
  This object detection brick utilizes a pre-trained model to analyze video streams from a camera.
  It identifies objects, returning their predicted class labels, bounding boxes, and confidence scores.
  The output is a video stream featuring bounding boxes around detected objects, with the added capability to trigger actions based on these detections.
  It supports pre-trained models provided by the framework and custom object detection models trained on the Edge Impulse platform.
